# Typescript Template
Just a repository with some basic typescript configuration. `ts-node`, linter and some `vs-code` integration.

## VSCode integration
This repo comes with two VSCode extensions configured that could aid the developing:

### Save and Run
[Save and Run](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wk-j.save-and-run): Execute the code on saving (or with a command). Very convenient for small changes.

### Eslint
[Eslint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint): Auto lint on save (or commit).
